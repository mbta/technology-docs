# RFCs

The RFC process here is inspired by [that of the Rust programming
language](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs).

The process is intended to provide TID team members a venue in which to propose substantial
technical changes and refactors to this application. The RFC will be reviewed and merged as either
accepted, meaning we commit to working on it at some point in the future, or rejected. The RFCs will
remain in the repository and be a source of historical information for anyone looking back for
information on the context and reasoning that went into some decisions.

This is intended for "larger" changes. As a rough heuristic, the process is for something that might
take a developer an entire sprint to accomplish, or more. The GitHub interface is pretty good for
allowing comments and discussion on particular points in the RFC, and the RFC can be iterated on
with subsequent commits. After the RFC is merged, the tech lead will turn it into Asana tasks.

We can continue to use Asana for bug reports and smaller tweaks that don't need team discussion.

Larger changes that have a user focus might go through a product and design cycle first. However,
for the implementation of the feature, the technical approach may be opened as an RFC for discussion
first.

## When you need to follow this process

You never _need_ to follow this process. In general, the tech lead is responsible for ensuring the
application is well architected, tested, performant, and functional, subject to organizational
constraints. However, this process is available to you if you have a good idea for how something
should change. Such changes may include:

- A substantial refactor, which takes a developer roughly an entire sprint or more.
- Public facing changes, which might need to be coordinated with other groups inside or outside of
  TID.

Changes that don't need an RFC may be:

- Smaller changes, which can use the normal inbound Asana flow.

When in doubt, feel free to ask!

## Before creating an RFC

A hastily-proposed RFC can hurt its chances of acceptance. Low quality proposals, proposals for
previously-rejected features, or those that don't fit into the near-term roadmap, may be quickly
rejected, which can be demotivating for the unprepared contributor. Laying some groundwork ahead of
the RFC can make the process smoother.

Although there is no single way to prepare for submitting an RFC, it is generally a good idea to
pursue feedback from other project developers beforehand, to ascertain that the RFC may be
desirable; having a consistent impact on the project requires concerted effort toward
consensus-building.

The most common preparations for writing and submitting an RFC include talking the idea over in our
team Slack channel, or during your 1-on-1 with the tech lead. If the proposal is likely to require a
chunk of time to write (for example, if you want to prove out and test a proof of concept or a part
of it), it may be possible to allot sprint time to it. Submit an inbound Asana task and it will be
reviewed and prioritized by the tech lead and product manager according to the road map and team
priorities.

For large changes, it's worth drafting and getting feedback on an RFC even before formally proposing
it. A fresh set of eyes may be able to quickly identify and resolve some issues before it's shared
with the wider organization, making the discussion of the formal proposal that much more productive.

## What the process is

- Copy `rfcs/0000-template.md` to `rfcs/0000-my-feature.md` (where "my-feature" is descriptive).
  Don't assign an RFC number yet; This is going to be the PR number and we'll rename the file
  accordingly if the RFC is accepted.
- Fill in the RFC. Put care into the details: RFCs that do not present convincing motivation,
  demonstrate lack of understanding of the design's impact, or are disingenuous about the drawbacks
  or alternatives tend to be poorly-received.
- Submit a pull request. As a pull request the RFC will receive design feedback from the team, and
  the author should be prepared to revise it in response.
- Now that your RFC has an open pull request, use the issue number of the PR to update your 0000-
  prefix to that number.
- Assign the RFC to the tech lead, and announce it in the Slack channel for all the team to review.
- RFCs rarely go through this process unchanged, especially as alternatives and drawbacks are shown.
  You can make edits, big and small, to the RFC to clarify or change the design, but make changes as
  new commits to the pull request, and leave a comment on the pull request explaining your changes.
  Specifically, do not squash or rebase commits after they are visible on the pull request.
- At some point, the tech lead will propose a "motion for final comment period" (FCP), along with a
  disposition for the RFC (accept or reject).
  - This step is taken when enough of the tradeoffs have been discussed that the tech lead is in a
    position to make a decision. That does not require consensus amongst all participants in the
    RFC thread (which is usually impossible). However, the argument supporting the disposition on
    the RFC needs to have already been clearly articulated, and there should not be a strong
    consensus against that position outside of the tech lead. The tech lead will use their best
    judgment in taking this step, and the FCP itself ensures there is ample time and notification
    for stakeholders to push back if it is made prematurely.
  - For RFCs with lengthy discussion, the motion to FCP is usually preceded by a summary comment
    trying to lay out the current state of the discussion and major tradeoffs/points of
    disagreement.

## The RFC life-cycle

Once an RFC becomes "active" then the tech lead will turn it into Asana tasks. Every accepted RFC
has an associated Asana task tracking its implementation; thus that associated task can be assigned
a priority via the triage process that the team uses for all work. The fact that a given RFC has
been accepted and is "active" implies nothing about what priority is assigned to its implementation,
nor does it imply anything about whether a developer has been assigned the task of implementing the
feature.

Modifications to "active" RFCs can be done in follow-up pull requests. We strive to write each RFC
in a manner that it will reflect the final design of the feature; but the nature of the process
means that we cannot expect every merged RFC to actually reflect what the end result will be.

In general, once accepted, RFCs should not be substantially changed. Only very minor changes should
be submitted as amendments. More substantial changes should be new RFCs, with a note added to the
original RFC. Exactly what counts as a "very minor change" is up to the tech lead to decide.

## Reviewing RFCs

While the RFC pull request is up, the tech lead may schedule meetings with the author and/or
relevant stakeholders to discuss the issues in greater detail, and in some cases the topic may be
discussed by the full team during a grooming. In either case a summary from the meeting will be
posted back to the RFC pull request.

## A "living" process

The RFC process itself can be modified, and that's encouraged! To do so, simply submit a PR with
changes to this README or to the template document.
