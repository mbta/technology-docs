- Status: Accepted

# Summary

This will enable us to publish in our static GTFS feed "canonical" data for our rail routes. We will
do so via a "canonical" service that's never active, but which has representative trips with stop
times and shapes. If a canonical trip is similar enough to a real-world trip that are otherwise
in the GTFS feed, then it will be made the representative trip of an existing route pattern. If no
such trips are being run (such as due to a long-running station closure), then a new, canonical
route pattern will be created, of which the canonical trip will be representative.

# Motivation

MBTA.com users are able to see line diagrams that match real-world state, including physical maps,
even when stations are closed for a long duration.

PIOs are able to create alerts for stations without any scheduled service, and T-Alerts subscribers
are able to stay informed about the status of the station closure.

# Guide-level explanation

GTFS output includes additional, hardcoded data about where rail lines go to and where they can stop
if all stations were open; these hardcoded data are independent of all scheduled service except that
they may be tied to scheduled route patterns in some cases.

This is represented as a service with ID "canonical", which is valid for the entire feed date range,
but which has no active days of the week. The typicality of the service is tagged with a new value
so it can be programmatically identified.

All rail routes have two or more trips on this service, corresponding to the "canonical" patterns of
service in each direction for any branches, as understood by stakeholders. Each such canonical trip
has a route pattern, for which it is the representative trip, and a shape. If current service has
trips following the same set and order of stops as the canonical trip, then the canonical trip will
reference‚Äîand become the representative trip for‚Äîthe current service's route pattern. If current
service has no trips resembling the canonical trip, then a separate, canonical route pattern will be
maintained in the GTFS output.

# Reference-level explanation

The canonical service appears in the following GTFS files in the following way:

- **calendar.txt** includes a new `service_id` to envelop all of the canonical trips on all the
  routes. `start_date` and `end_date` should reflect the feed's valid start/end dates. All other
  fields should have a value of `0`.
- **calendar_attributes.txt** includes the new `service_id`. `service_schedule_type` should be
  `"Other"`, and `rating_start_date` and `rating_end_date` should reflect the feed's valid start/end
  dates. `service_schedule_typicality` should be `6`, and the
  [docs](https://github.com/mbta/gtfs-documentation/blob/master/reference/gtfs.md) should be updated
  with this new kind of value.
- **route_patterns.txt** includes new route patterns for routes/directions we want to hardcode when
  the canonical trips (added in the trips file below) do not resemble any scheduled service. New
  patterns in this file shall have a new `route_pattern_typicality` value of should be `5`, and
  `route_pattern_sort_order` should be a greater than the value for all non-canonical route patterns
  for that given route/direction/branch. For routes with branches,
  you'll need a pattern for each route/direction/branch (eg, for Providence/Stoughton Line, you
  should have _two_ new route patterns in the outbound direction). Finally, a new
  `canonical_route_pattern` field is added to all route patterns, defined with the following values:
    - `0` or empty: Route does not have any canonical patterns defined.
    - `1`: Route pattern should be considered canonical for this route in this direction. If
      branching regularly occurs, this route-direction may have more than one canonical pattern.
    - `2`: Route pattern should be not considered canonical for this route in this direction.
- **shapes.txt** will add new shapes for all canonical subway trips, since the shape IDs can change
  between ratings, especially when stations are open and closed on a long-term basis. These new
  shapes can have an identical set of points as those shapes used during current service. Existing
  Commuter Rail shape references can be reused for canonical trips.
- **trips.txt** includes one new trip for each canonical route/direction pair, or multiple trips in
  the event of regular branching occuring along the route. It should reference the new `service_id`
  created above. It should reference either a new (canonical) or previously-existing (regular
  service) route pattern, depending on whether the trip's stopping pattern is currently served by
  regular service. Each of these trips should be the `representative_trip_id` for their referenced
  route patterns.
- **stop_times.txt** includes all stops that trains in the route/direction passes through, even if
  they are temporarily closed. Increment the arrival/departure times by one minute for each
  subsequent stop. For a sample, see the GTFS file attached to [‚úì üß™ üöù Canonical
  trips/patterns experiment](https://app.asana.com/0/881264583703207/1200210504369250), which
  trialled this for Green Line D and Lowell Line (only in the outbound direction).

There will be a new a directory, `input/canonical/` to store any static, canonical data that may 
become published. The determination of what canonical information is to be published will be added 
as part of the existing `truncate` phase (or made into a new, subsequent `canonical` phase if need 
be). This step will update any canonical trips to use current route patterns (and vice versa) if 
relevant, eliminating redundant route patterns.

For Commuter Rail route patterns, the canonical one will specify every stop as non-flag, non-leave
early stop. For both subway and Commuter Rail canonical trips, no data around bicycle allowances
will be provided (`bikes_allowed=0`).

# Drawbacks

This is more complicated than not doing it.

# Rationale and alternatives

See previously-proposed Concepts [1](https://github.com/mbta/technology-docs/pull/6#issuecomment-952315958), [4](https://github.com/mbta/technology-docs/pull/6#issuecomment-952315958), and [5](https://github.com/mbta/technology-docs/pull/6#issuecomment-962120434) in the pull request discussion.

# Prior art

Until now we've been doing ad-hoc adjustments to determine the route pattern of routes
[here](https://github.com/mbta/api/blob/master/apps/state/config/config.exs#L145).

# Unresolved questions

Earlier questions around sorting route patterns, and identifying canonical representative trip, have been resolved.

# Future possibilities

We could expose the new data more clearly in the API. For instance, the `service` can't be filtered by
its typicality, most relevantly when included with `trips`. We could add canonical trips and patterns for ferry and/or bus routes.
