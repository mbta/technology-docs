# Summary
[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already implemented and you were teaching it to a new developer
that just joined the team. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how programmers should *think* about the feature, and how it should impact the way they
  work on this project. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration guidance.
- If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to senior developers and to junior
  developers.

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how
the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. A few examples of what
this can include are:

- Can we learn something about this proposal from other projects in TID?
- Can we learn something about this proposal from other transit agencies?
- Can we learn something about this proposal from past experiences in other jobs or projects?

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other places,
and provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.

If there is no prior art, that is fine.

Note that while precedent is some motivation, it does not on its own motivate an RFC.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature
  before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the
  future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?

# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would
affect the project as a whole in a holistic way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully
consider all possible interactions with the project in your proposal. Also consider how this all
fits into the roadmap for the project.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you are writing but
otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply state that you cannot
think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section is not a reason to
accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be in the section on motivation or rationale
in this or subsequent RFCs. The section merely provides additional information.
