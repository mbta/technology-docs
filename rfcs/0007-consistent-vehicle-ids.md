- RFC PR: [mbta/technology-docs#7](https://github.com/mbta/technology-docs/pull/7)
- Asana task: [changing vehicle ids to make them consistent?](https://app.asana.com/0/116562505129567/1200545747038396)
- Status: Proposed

# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Internal MBTA application publish vehicle IDs with a consistent prefix so as to avoid overlaps.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Currently, the MBTA runs vehicles on 5 different modes:

- Bus
- Commuter Rail
- Ferry
- Heavy Rail (Red, Orange, and Blue Lines)
- Light Rail (Green Line and Mattapan)

Within and between these modes, the identifiers of the vehicle (printed on
the outside) can overlap, causing confusion in our real-time data. By
creating consistent prefixes for each mode, we can ensure that the
identifiers used in our real-time data are unique across all modes.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

<!--
Explain the proposal as if it was already implemented and you were teaching it to a new developer
that just joined the team. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how programmers should *think* about the feature, and how it should impact the way they
  work on this project. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration guidance.
- If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to senior developers and to junior
  developers. -->

Our vehicle information is published in our GTFS-RT VehiclePositions file. There are three fields which currently contain some vehicle information:

| Field | Description | Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | Internal system of identification for the vehicle. Should be unique to the vehicle | Heavy rail: the line the car is on plus a hex code that is unique for the consist<br>Light rail: "G-" plus a decimal code that is unique for the consist<br>Commuter Rail: the number of the control coach<br>Bus: the letter "y" plus the number of the bus |
| `label` | a user visible label - for example the name of a train | Heavy rail: the number of the lead car<br>Light rail: the numbers of each car in the consist, separated by `-`<br>Commuter Rail: the number of the control coach<br>Bus: the number of the bus |
| `consist` | Information about a single car in a multi-car train | Heavy/rail: `label` contains the number of each car making up the train, in order from front to back |

In particular, bus labels and commuter rail labels overlap, leading us to
prefix the bus IDs with a `y` to distinguish them. This works as long as we
only have one type of bus information. However, if we add additional sources
of bus data (such as contracted shuttle buses) we need another prefix in
order to distinguish the new vehicles.

To avoid this, this RFC introduces consistent prefixes to give each group of vehicles a unique namespace. The pattern is
`<vendor>-<mode/line>-<unique identifier>`.

| Mode / Line | Prefix | Old => New |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Red Line | `mbta-red` | `R-546C3C33` => `mbta-red-546C3C33` |
| Orange Line | `mbta-orange` | `O-546C3BA5` => `mbta-orange-546C3BA5` |
| Green Line / Mattapan High-Speed Rail | `mbta-green` | `G-10100` => `mbta-green-10100` |
| Blue Line | `mbta-blue` | `B-546C3C08` => `mbta-blue-546C3C08` |
| Commuter Rail | `keolis-rail` | `1809` => `keolis-rail-1809`
| MBTA Bus | `mbta-bus` | `y1454` => `mbta-bus-1454` |
| Yankee Shuttle Bus | `yankee-bus` | `ynk1234` => `yankee-bus-1234` |


Applications which generate vehicle IDs will need to be updated to generate
the new IDs, but do not need to coordinate amongst themselves: no mode/line
is generated by multiple applications.

While no developers should be dependent on the existing ID formats, we should
provide some notice (~1 month) via the Developer Google Group and our normal
check-ins with Keolis. It is also possible that Splunk Dashboards might need
to be updated, in particular for bus which has long used the `y` prefix.


# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

<!--
This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how
the detailed proposal makes those examples work. -->

The following applications will need to be updated:

| Application | Team |
| --- | --- |
| RTR | TRC |
| TrainLoc | TRC |
| Busloc | Bus Realtime |

The only code which should need to be updated is that which generates the
vehicle IDs, to use a different prefix. This should include vehicle IDs in
the VehiclePositions file, as well as any vehicle IDs generated for use in a
TripUpdates file.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

This is a small change, but if some clients relied on the old IDs they could break.

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

<!--
- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this? ==>

By using both the name of the vendor and the mode/line, we retain flexibility
for modes to be served by multiple vendors (such as Yankee for shuttle
buses). Although this flexibility may not be needed for the other modes at
present, we have changed Commuter Rail vendors in the past and so it is not
outside the realm of possiblity.

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

<!--
Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. A few examples of what
this can include are:

- Can we learn something about this proposal from other projects in CTD?
- Can we learn something about this proposal from other transit agencies?
- Can we learn something about this proposal from past experiences in other jobs or projects?

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other places,
and provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.

If there is no prior art, that is fine.

Note that while precedent is some motivation, it does not on its own motivate an RFC. -->

No prior art that I am aware of.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

<!--
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature
  before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the
  future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC? -->

- when will teams find the time in their sprints to make this change?
- will a developer external to the team (such as Paul) draft pull requests?

# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

<!--
Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would
affect the project as a whole in a holistic way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully
consider all possible interactions with the project in your proposal. Also consider how this all
fits into the roadmap for the project.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you are writing but
otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply state that you cannot
think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section is not a reason to
accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be in the section on motivation or rationale
in this or subsequent RFCs. The section merely provides additional information. -->

We could consider doing something similar for trip IDs in the future. At the
moment, MBTA and Keolis are both using HASTUS for scheduling, which uses
integer trip IDs. They do not currently overlap, but we don't know whether
that's a possiblity in the future. Changing the trip IDs would be a much
larger lift however, as not all applications (TransitMaster) support
non-integer trip IDs.
